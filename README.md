# post-command-hook [![NPM version][npm-image]][npm-url]
> Run a command and then all registered hook(s).

## Installation

```sh
$ npm install --save post-command-hook
```

or

```sh
$ yarn add post-command-hook
```

## Usage

Let's suppose we want to add [esdoc](https://github.com/esdoc/esdoc) to our project, create config file and generate a documentation. To achieve that we could create a file `esdoc-setup.js` and use the following snippet:

```js
const PostCommandHook = require('post-command-hook');

const postCommandHook = new PostCommandHook({ command: 'npm', args: ['i', '--save-dev', 'esdoc', 'esdoc-standard-plugin'] });
postCommandHook.use(() => {
  require('fs').writeFile("./.esdoc.json", `{
    "source": "./lib",
    "destination": "./docs",
    "plugins": [{"name": "esdoc-standard-plugin"}]
  }`, (err) => {
    if (err) {
      console.log(err);
    }
  });
}).use({ command: './node_modules/.bin/esdoc' });

(async () => {
  await postCommandHook.run();
})();
```

and run it:

```shell
$ node esdoc-setup.js
```

#### plugin
Type: `object`, `function` or an instance of class responding to `.run`.

### .setRunOnce(value)

Instructs to keep already performed commands in the registry and not to run them again. It allows you to add plugins and run them without executing previously issued commands.

##### value
